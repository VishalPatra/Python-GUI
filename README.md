This is a very crude attempt at making a GUI to write config files for SU2.
Need python's tkinter package
At the moment, the GUI can only write cfg files for some limited scenarios.

To use:
python muli_option_gui.py confile_file_name.cfg

A config file with the name specified in the command will be genrated. If no such file exists, a ne one is created and if a file by hat name already exists, it will be overwritten.
