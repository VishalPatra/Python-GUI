This is a very crude attempt at making a GUI to write config files for SU2.
The GUI can be started by running the program multi_option_gui.py. To use the GUI,  pythin compiler with tkinter is necessary.
At the moment, the GUI can only write cfg files for some limited scenarios.

To use
python muli_option_gui.py confile_file_name.cfg

A config file with the name specified in the command will be genrated. If no such file exists, a ne one is created and if a file by hat name already exists, it will be overwritten.
